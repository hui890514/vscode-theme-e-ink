# E-Ink Theme for VSCode

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hui890514.vscode-theme-e-ink" target="_blank"><img alt="Visual Studio Marketplace Installs" src="https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/i/hui890514.vscode-theme-e-ink?logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=ffffff&label=E-Ink%20Theme&labelColor=000000&color=dddddd" /></a>

This is a VSCode theme designed specifically for E-Ink displays.

> The color gray may look too light in a normal display, but believe me, try it and you will find it plays well in an E-Ink display, at least it does well in my DASUNG 13.3-inch display with Text Mode and Fast+++.
